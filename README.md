# ScarletQuasar üê∏

I like open source, software engineering, devops, self-hosted infrastructure and I want to do cosplay in the future.

Currently trying to develop meaningful solutions at [Growly Group](https://growly-group.xyz/)

## Some projects

- [MelonRuntime](https://github.com/scarletquasar/MelonRuntime) - Experimental JavaScript runtime that runs on top of .NET created to rapidly prototype projects
- [c-moon](https://github.com/scarletquasar/c-moon) - Developing a voice/visual assistant to run at home and help me in daily tasks
